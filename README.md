## Connect S3 storage as on-premises second storage 
The [CloudTier SDK](https://www.easefilter.com/cloud/storage-tiering-sdk.htm) integrates S3 Intelligent-Tiering cloud storage with on-premise storage systems seamlessly, creating a hybrid storage environment.  So it allows on-premise applications to access S3 file objects transparently, just as they would access on-premise regular files. There is no interruption to move or restore your on-premise files to/from the cloud storage, so you donâ€™t need to change your existing applications and infrastructure to be compatible with the cloud environment.

The [CloudTier S3 demo](https://www.easefilter.com/cloud/cloudtier-s3-intelligent-tiering-demo.htm) is a C# demo project, it demonstrates how to connect the S3 storage from your on-premise storage, and how to generate the test files in on-premise storage and S3 storage. It demonstrates how to browse and read the S3 files as a local regular files.
